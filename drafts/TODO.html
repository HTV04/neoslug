    <h1>TODO for the RU SLUG Website</h1>

    <h2>Move To A <code>rutgers.edu</code> Subdomain</h2>
    <p>As the
     <a href="https://cs.rutgers.edu">Department of Computer
     Science</a> recognizes us as a club. With our faculty advisor,
     Charles Hedrick, we are making ample progress towards restoring
     <code>ruslug.rutgers.edu</code> as our domain.</p>

    <h2>Get a Dedicated Server</h2>
    <p>Currently, the webmaster is using his own desktop as a
    webserver. For the small amount of traffic this site gets relative
    to the computational power available for the server to use, it is
    fine, but may be a security risk. We hope this sever may also find
    use as a SSH machine for the club's members.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Create a Mailing List</h2>
    <p>We hope to centralize discussion of the club, in particular
    announcements and upcoming events, in a publicly-viewable
    mailing list.</p>
